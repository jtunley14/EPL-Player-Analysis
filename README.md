# Analyzing Premier League Players in the 2023 Season
Welcome to my GitHub! 

Goals:
- Dive deep into why players are over / under-performing
- Find recommendations for how these players can improve their performance. This includes how their coach can put them in a better position to perform, as well as area for them to focus on.
- Identify elite players before they break out.
